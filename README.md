Welcome to the Hand Gesture Detection project! This repository contains code and resources for a computer vision project that focuses on recognizing and detecting hand gestures using machine learning techniques. The project aims to provide a foundation for building applications that can understand and respond to hand gestures, which can find applications in various fields such as human-computer interaction, sign language recognition, and more.

## Introduction

Hand gesture recognition is an essential task in computer vision that involves interpreting human hand movements to perform specific actions. This project showcases the development of a hand gesture detection system using deep learning techniques. The system is capable of identifying a predefined set of hand gestures and associating them with corresponding actions.

## Demo

Check out the project in action! The above GIF demonstrates the real-time hand gesture detection achieved by the trained model.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TejoVinay/Hand-Gesture-Recognition.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. It's recommended to set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd Hand-Gesture-Recognition
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After the installation, you can run the hand gesture detection system. Use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the application and open a webcam feed. Hold your hand in front of the camera and make gestures to see the detection in action.

## Model

The hand gesture detection model is built using a deep neural network architecture that has been trained on a labeled dataset of hand gesture images. The architecture leverages convolutional layers to automatically learn features from the input images and make predictions.

For more details on the architecture, training process, and evaluation, please refer to the [Model Documentation](model_documentation.md).

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is not included in this repository due to its size. However, instructions on how to obtain the dataset and preprocess it can be found in the [Dataset Documentation](dataset_documentation.md).
